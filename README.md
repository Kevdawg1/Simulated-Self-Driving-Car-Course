# Python Simulated Self-Driving Car 

This repository contains the drafted code of my performance in the [Udemy course]([https://www.udemy.com/course/applied-deep-learningtm-the-complete-self-driving-car-course/](https://www.udemy.com/course/applied-deep-learningtm-the-complete-self-driving-car-course/)) by Rayan Slim. The directories are organised to reflect the individual chapters of the course and the resultant projects of those principles.
